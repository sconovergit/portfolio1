        Alex had no way of getting new clients or a way to manage current clients.
      </p>
      <p>
        Amateur photographer did not have a website and made a lot more work for himself by doing every step of the process.  He needed a way to automate some of his services like giving the client the finished product and offering them a way to have prints and the digital copies.

        I used these surveys to see exactly what the user wanted out of a photography website.  Through this survey I learned that most users want to know an estimate of a price before they even take the time to contact the photographer.  I also learned the amount of photos most people wanted as well as what types of photos they wanted.

        The cloud storage market does not have a lot of competitors and seems
        ready for an application like WOLF. Google Drive, Pinterest, and Instagram
        were the 3 biggest platforms with similarities to WOLF.  I learned that I
        was going to have to incorporate every single feature from these companies
        into WOLF if it was going to be a success.

        Peter Mckinnon is a very popular youtuber/photographer/videographer.  He has dedicated his career to his art and although he no longer does private photos for people, he is still an aspirational competitor.  His website is user friendly but does not have much on it.  It seems to be mostly used for a way to contact him or buy merchandise.

        I tested 3 users about Alex's photography site so far.  The first question was having them navigate to the contact page.  All 3 did it with ease since it's on the side nav.  The next question was having them to preview some of Alex's work.  After clicking on portfolio they figured out that it was broken up into different categories.  The final task was to contact Alex.  Since this too was on the navigation they did not have a difficult time with it at all.

        These words are what kept popping up when initially interviewing the client.  He wanted to make sure it was easy to use for his clients and for them to be able to find what they were looking for as quickly as possible.  I also got lucky since he already had a logo so I could skip logo design.
