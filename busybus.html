      <h5> Problem </h5>
      <p class="firstsentence">
        Local transit system expanded their bus system and added many bus routes.
      </p>
      <p>
        With all these additional bus routes, people had no idea which bus was going to be at their bus stop next and at what time.

              Create an app, BusyBus, which would keep track of all of this information for the user.

      <p>
        I started with user surveys to figure out exactly what the users wanted from this app.  I learned that the biggest frustration for the users were the unknowns.  90% of users said their favorite part of their current apps was the real time updates on their bus arrival time.

        What's everyone else doing?

      <p>
        There is a lot of competition when it comes to transit apps but two of the biggest are GoogleMaps and Citymapper.  After this competitive analysis I concluded that BusyBus needs to be a mix of these two to become a major competitor.

        Strong, prominent company with lots of features and ways to view transit activity.  Very organized interface and easy to use.  Offers users multiple ways and options to travel via transit.

        Free to use, extremely popular social media app.  Minimal options for
        content creation but very easy to connect with people and make
        connections. Organization is hard to use and there are lots of competitors already in the market.

      <h5> User Stories </h5>
      <p class="firstsentence">
        What does the user need?
      </p>
      <p>
        I decided that although signing in, updating user names, and updating passwords is usually very high in importance, since Google Maps and Citymapper do not require a log in that we could save that for a later time, and with that login we could add things like receiving updates for the users favorite busses and stops.  Having a login will be good when we make the app more customizable for individual users, but for MVP I decided I should stick to exactly what the users asked for until the app is off the ground, in which we can add user specific items.

        I drew up 3 sketches to represent the flow from screen to screen as well as a quick, low-fidelity way to visualize what I wanted to design and code.

        What do the users like/dislike?

      <p>
        I tested 3 users and asked them some questions about WOLF so far.  In this first round I asked the participants about the homepage, to sign up for an account, add a piece of content, and to organize a piece of content. There were some sizing issues and a few incorrect paths.  Some features that I found worked very well were the menu for adding content being easy to find, the ease of saving content, and the obvious call to action buttons.

        In this project I have learned that even something as simple as a few screens can have a  lot of work involved.  I learned a lot from developing this project including how to properly structure an HTML document and target the proper classes.
