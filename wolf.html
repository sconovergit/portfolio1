        The cloud storage market does not have a lot of competitors and seems

        were the 3 biggest platforms with similarities to WOLF.  I learned that I

        into WOLF if it was going to be a success.

He uses Google Drive a lot for work  but has to use multiple apps to create the content that he wants in his buckets. Alex could benefit from our app by combining the sharing and sorting capabilities of all 3 apps as well as being able to create content, edit, save, and collaborate with his team.

          spreadsheets and Word documents.  If anyone on his team wants to add or edit any sort of document they have to go through Zach.  Zach could benefit from WOLF by allowing the team to edit documents and free up time for him.

        Marc only uses social media and apps like Pinterest if he just so happens to have a few spare minutes in his day.

Some features that I found worked very well were the menu for adding content being easy to find, the ease of saving content, and the obvious call to action buttons.
