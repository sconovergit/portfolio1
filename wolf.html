        The cloud storage market does not have a lot of competitors and seems

        were the 3 biggest platforms with similarities to WOLF.  I learned that I
        was going to have to incorporate every single feature from these companies
        into WOLF if it was going to be a success.

He uses Google Drive a lot for work  but has to use multiple apps to create the content that he wants in his buckets. Alex could benefit from our app by combining the sharing and sorting capabilities of all 3 apps as well as being able to create content, edit, save, and collaborate with his team.
