          An indecisive client wanted to enter the cloud

        The cloud storage market does not have a lot of competitors and seems
        ready for an application like WOLF. Google Drive, Pinterest, and Instagram
        were the 3 biggest platforms with similarities to WOLF.  I learned that I
        was going to have to incorporate every single feature from these companies
        into WOLF if it was going to be a success.

        I collected a lot of research on the potential user as well as my
        competitors.  I combined all of this into User Personas to help refine my
        requirements as well as to help me focus on designing to solve these users
        problems.  Having this template of users that I wanted to target helped me
        design with these users in mind.

        Alex currently uses Pinterest and Instagram for ideas for DIY projects for

        a lot for work  but has to use multiple apps to create the content that he
        wants in his buckets. Alex could benefit from our app by combining

        Zach currently only uses Pinterest and Instagram to blow off steam.
        Google Drive is something he does not use, and instead uses Excel
        spreadsheets and Word documents.  If anyone on his team wants to add or

        Everything that was a high priority was done so because it was necessary

        I tested 3 users and asked them some questions about WOLF so far.  In this
        first round I asked the participants about the homepage, to sign up for an
        account, add a piece of content, and to organize a piece of content.
        There were some sizing issues and a few incorrect paths.  Some features
        that I found worked very well were the menu for adding content being easy
        to find, the ease of saving content, and the obvious call to action
        buttons.
